% EXPERIENCE B
%====================
\subsection{{Natural Language Processing Forum Post Classifer}}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Developed a supervised machine learning program in C++ to label posts to an online forum by topic
\item Implemented a simplified version of a Multi-Variate Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier to group posts by the words they contain
\item Designed a custom-built Map container using an underlying custom-built Binary Search Tree to assist with classification
\item Trained model using a large dataset to predict labels with 87\% accuracy
\end{zitemize}

% EXPERIENCE A
%====================
\subsection{{Content Aware Image Resizing Program }}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Used computer vision principles to develop a C++ program that intelligently resizes images based on their content
\item Implemented a seam carving algorithm to remove non-essential pixels based on a cost matrix calculated from RGB data
\item Gained experience using a unit testing framework in order to debug and test the program
\end{zitemize}



%====================
% EXPERIENCE C
%====================
% \subsection{{Traffic Light Controller Circuit}}
% \begin{zitemize}
% \item Used the Verilog hardware description language to create a sequential digital circuit that implements the logic of a traffic light, using simulated sensor signals and output lights
% \item Used Intel Quartus to program design to an FPGA board to simulate and visually display the inputs and outputs of the circuit
% \item Tested and modeled the design using ModelSim
% \end{zitemize}

%====================
% EXPERIENCE D
%====================
\subsection{{Assembly code Assembler, Linker, and Simulator }}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Developed C programs to assemble an LC2k assembly code file into object files, link multiple machine code files together, and simulate the resulting executable to gain experience working with computer organization
\item Tested the system by developing many assembly code programs, such as ones implementing calculating fibonacci sequences
\item Updated the Simulator from a single cycle processor system to a pipelined processor that executes multiple instructions concurrently
\end{zitemize}
